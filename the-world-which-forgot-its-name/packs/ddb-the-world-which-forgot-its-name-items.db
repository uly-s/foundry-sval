If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>\n<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>\n<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>\n<p><strong>Ivory Goats.</strong> These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three.

It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <strong>lance, +1</strong>, and the other becomes a <strong>longsword, +2</strong>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours.

Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\n<p>While you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p>\n<h4>Random Properties</h4>\n<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Spells</h4>\n<p>The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).</p>\n<p>You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.</p>\n<h4>Call Dragons</h4>\n<p>While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p>\n<h4>Destroying an Orb</h4>\n<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 225","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"BE1AvdNlONTKAxyV":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/18/944/636381778343173324.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/8/317/636302830046095828.jpeg","filterType":"Wondrous item","tags":["Healing","Summoning","Control","Scrying","Detection"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":225,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/8/317/636302830046095828.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":4690,"originalName":"Orb of Dragonkind","version":"2.9.17"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"_id":"am6cHKPIhds3fcSI"}

If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>\n<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>\n<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>\n<p>Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Ivory Goats  (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a lance, +1, and the other becomes a longsword, +2. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>\n<p>If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p>\n<p>Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Darkvision]{darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet and can see @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Invisible]{invisible} creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.</p>\n<p>Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the animal messenger spell on it at will.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 169","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"varies","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"BE1AvdNlONTKAxyV":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/216/636284733359233869.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/217/636284733359592520.jpeg","filterType":"Wondrous item","tags":["Summoning"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":169,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/217/636284733359592520.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":5413,"originalName":"Figurine of Wondrous Power","version":"2.9.17"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"_id":"eEDlwC4tiMxX8vH0"}

You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>\n<p><strong>Jester.</strong> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>\n<p><strong>Key.</strong> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Knight.</strong> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>\n<p><strong>Moon.</strong> You are granted the ability to cast the <strong>wish</strong> spell 1d3 times.</p>\n<p><strong>Rogue.</strong> A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a <strong>wish</strong> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruin.</strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>\n<p><strong>Skull.</strong> You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.</p>\n<div class=\"line monster height1 marginTop15 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<h5>Avatar of Death</h5>\n<p><em>Medium undead, neutral evil</em></p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 20 <br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> half the hit point maximum of its summoner <br /><strong>Speed</strong> 60 ft., fly 60 ft.
