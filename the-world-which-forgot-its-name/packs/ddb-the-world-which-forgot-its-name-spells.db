If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM's choice).</p>\n<p>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p>\n<p>Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p>\n<p>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p>\n<p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 265","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":10,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":null,"type":null},"range":{"value":60,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":6,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"BE1AvdNlONTKAxyV":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":138548,"definitionId":2204,"entityTypeId":435869154,"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"generic","lookupName":"generic","level":null,"castAtLevel":null},"originalName":"Planar Ally","sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":265,"sourceType":1}],"tags":["Summoning"],"version":"2.9.17","effectsApplied":true}}}

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>\n<p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <strong>wish</strong> spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <br />You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n<p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <strong>wish</strong> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 288","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":null,"type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"heal","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":9,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"BE1AvdNlONTKAxyV":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":138951,"definitionId":2303,"entityTypeId":435869154,"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"generic","lookupName":"generic","level":null,"castAtLevel":null},"originalName":"Wish","sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":288,"sourceType":1}],"tags":["Creation","Healing","Buff"],"version":"2.9.17","effectsApplied":true}}}

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.

If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.</p>\n<p>The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word <strong>Rudnogg</strong> on the lips.\"</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 254","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":10,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":null,"type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":5,"school":"div","components":{"value":"incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each","consumed":true,"cost":250,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"BE1AvdNlONTKAxyV":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":138376,"definitionId":2163,"entityTypeId":435869154,"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"generic","lookupName":"generic","level":null,"castAtLevel":null},"originalName":"Legend Lore","sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":254,"sourceType":1}],"tags":["Utility"],"version":"2.9.17","effectsApplied":true}}}

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>\n<p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>\n<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall.
